# -Spam-mail-detection

Spam Mail Detection – Project Brief
This project focuses on building a system to automatically detect and classify email messages as spam or ham (not spam) using machine learning techniques.

Model Development:
A spam classification model was developed using Python and key libraries such as scikit-learn for text processing and machine learning.

Data Preprocessing:
Email datasets were cleaned and preprocessed—this included converting text to lowercase, removing special characters, and vectorizing the text (e.g., using Bag-of-Words). The Naive Bayes algorithm, a commonly used and effective method for text classification, was used to train the model. (Note: “Test-Trail” seems like a typo—possibly meant “train-test split” or “trial testing”)

Optimization:
To improve the model’s accuracy and efficiency, feature selection techniques were applied. This helped reduce noise in the data and focus on the most relevant words or patterns that indicate spam.
